### Hi there, I'm a FullStack Developer! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end development, including mobile. I'm excited to apply my skills in a professional setting.

With a successful career as a Senior Manager in a Technology and Innovation Consultancy, leading projects with some of the biggest Brazilian tech companies, such as XP Inc, Mercado Libre, among others, I started teaching myself how to code.

What started as a hobby, quickly became something I was truly passionate about, and now I create end-to-end software solutions, including web and mobile applications.
